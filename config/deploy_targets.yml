# Deployment Targets Configuration
#
# This file defines all deployment targets for the Sofia application.
# Each target specifies the deployment location, stage, hostname, and URL.
#
# To add a new deployment target:
#   1. Add a new entry below with the target name as the key (deployment identifier)
#   2. Set deploy_path to the docker directory path on the server
#   3. Set stage to the Rails environment (production or staging)
#   4. Set hostname to the application's domain
#   5. Set url to the HTTPS URL for GitHub Actions deployment tracking
#   6. Set branch_restriction to limit deployments to specific branches
#   7. Set allow_targets to restrict which deployment systems can use this target
#
# After adding a deployment target:
#   - Copy the .env and docker-compose files to the deploy_path on the server
#   - Setup TransIP DNS records to point to the server's IP
