The source code belonging to Alpha SOFIA. It is a system built with Ruby on Rails with Turbolinks and a little VueJS, used to manage orders in our own bar "Flux". Users authenticate via OAuth API (currently "Alpha AMBER") or through the builtin login portal to see how much credit they got left, or to be able to register new orders and/or payments.

### Credentials

Before you can start the application you will need the `master.key`. Ask a fellow developer for it, or pull it from the server via ssh.

When the `master.key` is present, you can use `bundle exec rails credentials:edit` to open the default editor on your machine to read and edit the credentials. Be informed: these are production credentials so be careful.

[Read more about Rails credentials on EngineYard.com.](https://www.engineyard.com/blog/rails-encrypted-credentials-on-rails-5.2)

```
$ EDITOR=nano bundle exec rails credentials:edit
```

### Configuring roles

Users can have roles in SOFIA, namely Treasurer ("SB-penningmeester"), Renting manager("Verhuur")and/or Main Bartender ("Hoofdtapper"). A user can also log in without a role. These roles are derived from the groups the user is in. These groups are saved in the AMBER API.

Roles are created in the following way during the seeding:

```ruby
Role.create(role_type: :treasurer, group_uid: 4)
Role.create(role_type: :renting_manager, group_uid: 5)
Role.create(role_type: :main_bartender, group_uid: 6)
```

## Testing & Linting

To Run the test locally the following command can be used 
```
bundle exec rspec
```

To run the linting locally you can use the following commands 
```
yarn lint
yarn run sass-lint -v -q
bundle exec rubocop
```

## Deploying

Deploying procedure is the same as for the AMBER project.
See [DEPLOY.md](https://github.com/csvalpha/amber-api/blob/master/DEPLOY.md) for that.
